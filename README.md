# Raytracer
A ray tracer written in Rust to learn about ray tracing, and computer graphics more generally. This project is the successor to an earlier project of mine, https://github.com/brendanburkhart/go-raytracer, a simpler ray tracer written in Go.

Currently supports loading models from the Wavefront [.OBJ format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavefront_.obj_file), as well as materials and textures from the companion .MTL format.

Examples:
![Classic teapot on checkered background](/examples/teapot.png "Classic teapot on checkered background")
![3D FIRST Robotics Competition Logo](/examples/first-logo.png "#D FIRST Robotics Competition Logo")
